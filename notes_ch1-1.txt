applicative order vs normal order--
    (see 1.1.3) applicative order evaluation--
        1. evaluate the subexpressions of the combination
        2. apply the procedure that is the value of the operator to the values of the operands
    (1.1.5) normal order evaluation--
        1. substitute operand expressions for parameters until you obtain an expression
           of only primitive operands
        2. evaluate the subexpressions of the combination
NB: Scheme uses applicative-order evaluation

1.1.7--
    "In mathematics we are usually concerned with declarative (what is) descriptions, whereas
     in computer science we are usually concerned with imperative (how to) descriptions."
